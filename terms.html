This includes, without limitation, direct loss, loss of business or profits (whether or not the loss of such profits was foreseeable, arose in the normal course of things or you have advised this Company of the possibility of such potential loss), damage caused to your computer, computer software, systems and programs and the data thereon or any other direct or indirect, consequential and incidental damages. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This Company does not however exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence. The above exclusions and limitations apply only to the extent permitted by law. None of your statutory rights as a consumer are affected.</p>
        <h4>Privacy</h4>
        <p>We respect your privacy. Information about you will not be sold or shared with outside parties.</p>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>All orders placed at SpiralComics.com are processed over a secure, encrypted connection using 128 bit SSL.</p>
        <p>Once your order information is received, information including your name, address, and credit card information is stored encrypted in our database. We do not store credit card information at this time.</p>
        <p>SpiralComics absolutely does not share your name, address, or credit card information with any third party without your express permission. It is our commitment to keep your personal information private and confidential at all times.</p>
        <h4>Shipping</h4>
        <p>Shipping for all orders is a flat rate of $5.00 plus $0.50 for each additional item. You may also have your books shipped twice a month or weekly in the United States. There is an additional shipping charge per month if you would like twice a month shipments. These options are only available for orders containing books.</p>
        <h4>Shipping to PO Boxes, APO, FPO, Hawaii, and Alaska</h4>
        <p>Orders sent to PO Boxes, FPO, APO, Alaska, Hawaii, and other U.S. territories are sent by USPS and are subject to actual shipping costs. The flat rate shipping cost will be assessed to the order it is placed. When the order is packaged, the actual cost adjustments will be made to the order at that time. The only option for ground shipping to these locations is the US Postal Service and the rates are much higher than those we negotiate with our shipping carrier. Packages sent by the US Postal Service by this method are not insured, but may be insured for an additional cost. If customers do not choose insurance, we are unable to replace lost packages. Customers in these locations may also request Priority shipping either in flat rate boxes or by Priority Mail at actual cost. Please inquire for costs.</p>
        <h4>Payments</h4>
        <p>All payments are processed through PayPal. PayPal allows you to make payments using a variety of methods including: PayPal Balance, PayPal Credit, bank account, all major credit cards, PayPal Cards, and debit cards.</p>
